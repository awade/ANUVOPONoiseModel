# ANUVOPONoiseModel
Noise Model for ANU style doubly resonant optical parametric oscillator for squeezing.

This repository contains matlab scripts for modelling the noise sources present in doubly resonant optical parametric oscillators.

Much of this work is based on the formalism outlined in the thesis work of Kirk McKenzie (2008).  Much of the background is covered in his dissertation.  

All computations are carried in dimension-4 matrixes and vectors to encompass fundamental and harmonic fields and their conjugates.
